LightOpenIdYii - A lightopenid Wrapper for Yii
==============================================

This wrapper class allows to use lightopenid as a component in Yii framework
applications. The lightopenid project is included as a git submodule. So changes
made there, can easily be carried over.

Currently it uses only Google for authentication because it's relatively easy to
just use the URL "https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id" (no need for user
action). I haven't found out where to redirect users for login through other
OpenID providers yet.

Usage
-----

Add as a git submodule:
git submodule add git://github.com/hofrob/LightOpenIdYii.git

Or download the files and put them in the extension directory.

Import the directory through your Yii config file.

[code]
'import' => array(
	[..]
	'ext.LightOpenIdYii.*',
	[..]
),
[/code]

Configure the component.

[code]
'components' => array(
	[..]
	'openid' => array(
		'class' => 'LightOpenIdWrapper',
	),
	[..]
),
[/code]

You can make use of the UserController provided in this package by mapping it in
the config.

[code]
'controllerMap' => array(
	'user' => array(
		'class' => 'ext.LightOpenIdYii.UserController',
	),
),
[/code]

The following views will need to be created:
* loggedin
* cancelled
* logout

In UserIdentity I invoke a static method of my user model to write/load
information from my database. Change this to fit your needs.

[code]
$this->id = User::syncWithDb($this->openid);
[/code]

IMPORTANT: You can have two different OpenIDs with Google. One is just a
google.com/accounts[..] link. Everyone with a Google account has it. But if you
signed up with Google Plus you get a second ID (your Google Plus profile URL). I
haven't found out when Google returns what ID. Unfortunately it seems to me that
this is random.

You COULD take care of this problem in your database by using the email address
as an identifier and connect two IDs where these fields are equal. But don't
take my word that this will actually work. It's just an idea.


TODO
----

* Configure required fields with Yii config files.
* Configure OpenID identifier with Yii config files (Wrapper Line 11).
* Login through other OpenID providers.
